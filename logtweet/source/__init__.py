"""Package with components regarding source content retrieval."""

# TODO: (1) Refactor package into sub-packages `usecases`, `adapters`, `controllers`.
#       This should make the intent of each package much more obvious.
#       I do not have any thing for the controller package yet, but that is coming.


# TODO: (2) Change import style. Try to use plain `import module.py` instead of `from x import y`.
#       You only save a little typing, but the code becomes less readable.
#       `import module.py` looks for the module in the current directory first.
#       Only if it is not found does the importer go to the path. Local modules
#       always have precedence over global/site ones.
